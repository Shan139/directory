CMUSV Directory

Purpose:
Allow a user to log into a [name]@west.cmu.edu account and access the CMUSV directory on a smart phone within a visually appealing interface.
Be able to call and email people from phone without having to dig into the Rails web site for details.

Market analysis:
No such application exists - everyone accesses the web site for the contact information and then call/email people. 
A mobile application would be useful to any one with an Android phone at CMUSV.

Initial development plan:
- Find out whether the application is viable (need to see whether can log into [name]@west.cmu.edu accounts using Android account manager; need to see whether can get access to the rails.sv.cmu.edu website)
- If the application is found to be viable, work on a visually appealing UI
- Implement functionality to get the JSON processed in android.
- Implement functionality to store photos, name phone number and email id.
- Implement functionality to enable my application to call or email people.
